# Android Processing Boilerplate
A processing.org - boilerplate for Android Studio projects

I followed https://github.com/processing/processing-android/wiki/Using-Eclipse-or-Android-Studio-for-Development
to create an android wrapper for the processing language. This is an Android Studio project using Android API 11.

The app draws some example graphics, loads a json from the network and displays text and animation.
A method which loads and parses json is also included. This app is supposed to be a quick-start to create
processing visualizations. *For more details, see processing.org.
